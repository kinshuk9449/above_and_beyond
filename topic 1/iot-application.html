      IoT applications promise to bring immense value into our lives.
      With newer wireless networks, superior sensors and revolutionary computing capabilities, the Internet of Things
      could be the next frontier in the race for its share of the wallet.
      IoT applications are expected to equip billions of everyday objects with connectivity and intelligence.</div>

      Imagine an intelligent device such as a traffic camera.
      The camera can monitor the streets for traffic congestion, accidents, weather conditions, and communicate this
      data to a common gateway.
      This gateway also receives data from other such cameras and relays the information further to a city-wide traffic
      monitoring system.

    Now, take, for instance, the Municipal Corporation decides to repair a certain road. This may cause a traffic
    congestion on the way to a national highway. This insight is sent to the city-wide traffic monitoring system.
  </p><p>
    Now, considering this is a smart traffic system, it quickly learns and predicts patterns in traffic, with the use of
    Machine Learning. The smart system can, thus, analyze the situation, predict its impact and relay the information to
    other cities that connect to the same highway via their own respective smart systems.
  </p><p>
    The Traffic Management System can analyze data acquired and derive routes around the project to avoid bottlenecks.
    The system could also convey live instructions to drivers through smart devices and radio channels. Meanwhile, the
    city schools and workplaces near the project could also be called to adjust their schedules.
